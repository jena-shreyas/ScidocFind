Third, the approach does not support dynamically evolving networks.", "method_label": "The algorithms essentially materialize a snapshot of the overlapping communities in the network. This approach has three drawbacks, however. First, the mining algorithm uses the same global criterion to decide whether a subgraph qualifies as a community.

In doing so, each search can use community criterion tailored for the vertex in the search. To support this approach, we introduce a novel model for overlapping communities, and we provide theoretical guidelines for tuning the model.

Our results show that while increasing diversity does have a negative impact on social capital, it simultaneously improves perceptions of, and relations between, ethnic groups. ties in diverse environments plays a significant role in the positive relationship between diversity and tolerance, and that the presence of ?bridging? ties can also reduce the negative impact of diversity on social capital. However, while our results show that diversity has both positive and negative effects on social cohesion, we find that it is disadvantage which has the most detrimental impact, undermining both social capital and interethnic relations. We also find evidence that using a more sensitive measure of diversity (creating an area typology based on the proportional size, number, and type of ethnic groups in an area) reveals that living in different structures of diversity may lead to different social cohesion outcomes."}, {"paper_id": "15914419", "adju_relevance": 0, "title": "Mixed-initiative social media analytics at the World Bank: Observations of citizen sentiment in Twitter data to explore \"trust\" of political actors and state institutions and its relationship to social protest", "background_label": "The results of the study reveal that the 2014 World Cup protests in Brazil sprang from a wide range of grievances coupled with a relative sense of deprivation compared with emergent comparative `standards'.", "method_label": "This sense of grievance gave rise to sentiments that activated online protest that may have led to other forms of social protest, such as demonstrations.", "result_label": "The paper describes an innovative approach to big data analytics-mixed initiative social media analytics - and discusses the potential of using big data in social science research of this kind, as well as some of the open methodological, technical and ethical issues still to be addressed.", "abstract": " The results of the study reveal that the 2014 World Cup protests in Brazil sprang from a wide range of grievances coupled with a relative sense of deprivation compared with emergent comparative `standards'.
