In SOAP, each node connects to its social friends; i.e., nodes form a distributed overlay by directly using social network links as overlay links. The explosive growth of unsolicited e-mails has prompted the development of numerous spam filter techniques. Bayesian spam filters are superior to static keyword-based spam filters in that they can continuously evolve to tackle new spam by learning keywords in new spam emails. However, Bayesian spam filters are easily poisoned by clever spammers who avoid spam keywords and add many innocuous words in their emails. Also, Bayesian spam filters need a significant amount of time to adapt to a new spam based on user feedback. Moreover, few current spam filters exploit social networks to assist in spam detection. Each node uses SOAP to collect information and check spam autonomously in a distributed manner.

Also, Bayesian spam filters need a significant amount of time to adapt to a new spam based on user feedback. Moreover, few current spam filters exploit social networks to assist in spam detection. Each node uses SOAP to collect information and check spam autonomously in a distributed manner. Unlike previous spam filters that focus on parsing keywords (e.g., Bayesian filters) or building blacklists, SOAP exploits the social relationships among email correspondents and their (dis)interests to detect spam adaptively and automatically. In order to develop an accurate and user-friendly spam filter, we propose a SOcial network Aided Personalized and effective spam filter (SOAP) in this paper. In each node, SOAP integrates four components into the basic Bayesian filter: social closeness-based spam filtering, social interest-based spam filtering, adaptive trust management, and friend notification. In SOAP, each node connects to its social friends; i.e., nodes form a distributed overlay by directly using social network links as overlay links. We have evaluated the performance of SOAP using simulation based on trace data from Facebook.

Widespread Internet use has led to the emergence of several kinds of large-scale social networks in cyberspace, most notably e-mail networks. Unfortunately, the tremendous convenience that e-mail affords comes at a high price: Although the network's underlying connectivity is hidden, making it almost impossible to build a comprehensive directory of every individual's contact lists, e-mail addresses themselves can be easily obtained from publicly available documents. Spammers have exploited this vulnerability to inundate users with unsolicited bulk e-mail.

The statistical fingerprints left by median filtering can be a valuable clue for image forensics. However, these fingerprints may be maliciously erased by a forger. Recently, a tricky anti-forensic method has been proposed to remove median filtering traces by restoring images' pixel difference distribution. In this paper, we analyze the traces of this anti-forensic technique and propose a novel counter method. The experimental results show that our method could reveal this anti-forensics effectively at low computation load.
