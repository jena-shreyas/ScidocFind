In order to predict the price fluctuation of Bitcoin, we analyse the comments posted in the Bitcoin online forum. Unlike most research on Bitcoin-related online forums, which is limited to simple sentiment analysis and does not pay sufficient attention to note-worthy user comments, our approach involved extracting keywords from Bitcoin-related user comments posted on the online forum with the aim of analytically predicting the price and extent of transaction fluctuation of the currency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on Bitcoin online forum data ranging over a period of 2.8 years from December 2013 to September 2016."}, {"paper_id": "6638462", "adju_relevance": 0, "title": "Ally Friendly Jamming: How to Jam Your Enemy and Maintain Your Own Wireless Connectivity at the Same Time", "method_label": "The basic idea is to jam the wireless channel continuously but properly control the jamming signals with secret keys, so that the jamming signals are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices, but are recoverable by authorized ones equipped with the secret keys.
