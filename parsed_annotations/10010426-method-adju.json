In this paper, we introduce an automatic approach in deriving polarity pattern rules to detect sentiment polarity at the phrase level, and in addition consider the effects of the more complex relationships found between words in sentiment polarity classification. Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing, providing a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of textual data. By detecting the opinion expressed, we can identify the sentiments on the topics discussed and the influence exerted on the readers.

Recent sentiment analysis research has focused on the functional relations of words using typed dependency parsing, providing a refined analysis on the grammar and semantics of textual data. Heuristics are typically used to determine the typed dependency polarity patterns, which may not comprehensively identify all possible rules. We study the use of class sequential rules (CSRs) to automatically learn the typed dependency patterns, and benchmark the performance of CSR against a heuristic method. Preliminary results show CSR leads to further improvements in classification performance achieving over 80% F1 scores in the test cases. Preliminary results show CSR leads to further improvements in classification performance achieving over 80% F1 scores in the test cases. In addition, we observe more complex relationships between words that could influence phrase sentiment polarity, and further discuss on possible approaches to handle the effects of these complex relationships."}, {"paper_id": "3403945", "adju_relevance": 0, "title": "Politics, sharing and emotion in microblogs", "background_label": "In political contexts, it is known that people act as \"motivated reasoners\", i.e., information is evaluated first for emotional affect, and this emotional reaction influences later deliberative reasoning steps.

Four experiments examined the relationship among massive practice, speed-up of memory retrieval, and the reduction of long-term memory interference. All experiments employed a multiday fact recognition procedure. Interference was varied by a fan manipulation: Concepts could appear in more than one fact (fan) or only one fact (no fan). We found that fact retrieval speeds up as a power function of days of practice but that the number of daily repetitions beyond four produced little or no impact on reaction time. In addition, interference decreased in proportion to the degree of practice but did not disappear even with 25 days of practice.

Chapters 5 and 6 address computational aspects of the implementation of argumentation systems. The aspects in question include the argumentation interaction, which is typically a dialogue; the construction and presentation of arguments for or against a proposition; the interpretation of arguments; the knowledge representation required to build and interpret arguments; theory of rhetoric; and applications such as agent negotiation, legal argument, and decision-support systems.Argumentation is a rich interdisciplinary area of study, which so far has largely been considered separately by practitioners in different fields.

The six chapters of the book are outlined below. ''A Roadmap of Research in Argument and Computation,'' by Reed and Norman, motivates the subsequent chapters and provides background on three main areas of research that are relevant to these chapters: artificial intelligence, rhetoric, and multiagent systems. To address this problem, Reed and Norman brought together researchers in argumentation, artificial intelligence, law, linguistics, and philosophy, with the aim of writing a book about argumentation that would foster interdisciplinary work (see the book's Preface).The book comprises six chapters, each written by a different group of people, which cover diverse areas where argumentation has computational implications. Chapter 1 introduces the book. Chapters 2-4 consider argumentation in the context of multiagent, decision-support, and legal systems, focusing on rhetorical and representational issues that need to be taken into account when implementing such systems. The discussion is supported by an extensive list of references (although there are some omissions).In ''Argument and Multi-agent Systems,'' by Norman, Carbogim, Krabbe, and Walton, the authors address issues at the intersection of argumentation and multiagent systems.

AbstractBlogs and forums are widely adopted by online communities to debate about various issues. However, a user that wants to cut in on a debate may experience some difficulties in extracting the current accepted positions, and can be discouraged from interacting through these applications. In our paper, we combine textual entailment with argumentation theory to automatically extract the arguments from debates and to evaluate their acceptability."}, {"paper_id": "2977361", "adju_relevance": 0, "title": "Predicting personality with social behavior: a comparative study", "background_label": "In this paper, we study the problem of predicting personality with features based on social behavior.
