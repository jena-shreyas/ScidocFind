In this paper, we study 986 real-world networks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social networks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models. Our study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random forest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network domains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish based purely on network structure. Our results indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish based purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of network categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints and/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of engineering by human being, etc. Our results indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish based purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of network categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints and/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of engineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network, whether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a decisive factor of the formation of similar network structure.

The work of Barabasi <i>et al.</i> [2], and its application to network topology generation in the work of Medina <i>et al.</i> [9], have explored a promising class of models that yield strict power-law degree distributions. These models, which we will refer to collectively as the <i>B-A model</i>, describe the detailed dynamics of the network growth process, modeling the way in which connections are made between ASs. These observations were gleaned from more complete pictures of AS - level connectivity (obtained by augmenting BGP route tables with peering relationships from other sources) than those used by earlier work [2, 6, 9]. Second, the B-A model's AS connectivity evolution rules can be shown to be inconsistent with empirical AS growth measurements [16]. As such, while the B-A model appears to produce topologies whose degree distribution characteristics exhibit power-law behavior, it cannot be a valid <i>explanation</i> for the connectivity evolution in the AS topology. Clearly, some of these empirical observations don't corroborate the claim that the B-A model explains the phenomenon of highly variable vertex degrees in the Internet's AS topology [2]. However, the B-A model was originally proposed as a simple illustration of how some elementary mechanisms or rules can give rise to power law vertex degree distributions. As such, it is likely that the B-A model can be modified to accommodate these more recent findings [1], but we will neither discuss here such modifications nor comment on their possibility for success. There are two simple connectivity rules that define the evolution of AS connectivity over time: <i>incremental growth</i> where a new AS connects to existing ASs, and <i>preferential connectivity</i> where the likelihood of connecting to an AS is proportional to the vertex outdegree of the target AS. These simple rules, which are similar to the classical \"rich get richer\" model originally proposed by Simon [12], lead to power-law degree distributions. Instead, we merely note that any such resulting model would seek, as does the original B-A model, to explain the highly variable degree distribution of the AS topology through the detailed dynamics of how connections between ASs are established."}, {"paper_id": "13561769", "adju_relevance": 0, "title": "Multiplex lexical networks reveal patterns in early word acquisition in children", "background_label": "Network models of language have provided a way of linking cognitive processes to the structure and connectivity of language.
