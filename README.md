# SciDocFind-Faceted Ranked Retrieval of Scientific Research Papers

## Paper 
- The link for the paper is available [here](https://github.com/jena-shreyas/ScidocFind/blob/main/Reports/SciDocFind-Faceted_Ranked_Retrieval_of_Scientific_Research_Papers.pdf) : 
## Instructions
- [Final_baselines_inference.ipynb]
Run this python code after uploading CSFCube-master.zip*(connecting to GPU is optional but for faster inferences it's required) to get the evaluation metrics like R-Precsion, Precision@20, and others for all the baseline models. \
A total of 7 baselines are implemented which consists of 3 abstract level baselines and 4 sentence level baselines.


- [Final_finetune_inference.ipynb]
Run this python code after uploading CSFCube-master.zip*(connecting to GPU is optional but for faster inferences it's required) to get the evaluation metrics like R-Precsion, Precision@20, and others for all the finetuned models. Three models are finetuned where one is sentence level model and two are abstract level models.

- [Final_Sentbert_PP_finetune.ipynb]
Run all cells after uploading PARADE_dataset-main.zip*.

- [Final_specter_scincl_finetune.ipynb]
Run all cells after connecting to GPU for faster performance.

- [Final_Demo.ipynb]
Run all cells after uploading CSFCube-master.zip*.

- [SciRepEval_SciBERT_classifier.ipynb]
Run all cells after connecting to GPU for faster performance.
